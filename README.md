# Computer Aided Diagnosis Algorithm in dermoscopic images 

## No DL approach

The input data are dermoscopic images in JPEG format. The distribution of disease states represents a modified real world setting whereby there are more benign lesions than malignant lesions, but an overrepresentation of malignancies. The lesion images come from the HAM10000 Dataset (ViDIR Group, Medical University of Vienna), the BCN_20000 Dataset (Hospital Clínic de Barcelona) and the MSK Dataset (ISBI 2017), hence images were acquired with a variety of dermatoscope types and from different anatomic sites. Images were acquired from a historical sample of patients that presented for skin cancer screening from several different institutions.

•Challenge 1: The binary problem of classifying Nevus images vs all the others. There aremore than 15000 images, being half of them nevus and the other half a combination of abnormal areas to train the system. The test set will be open the last week of the project.

• Challenge 2: A three-class problem consisting on the classification of cancers: melanoma vs basal cell carcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma. The training set consists on more than 5000 images, being 50% melanoma, 40% basal cell carcinoma and only 10% squamous cell carcinoma (imbalanced problem).
